# Cryptocurrencies

##  Analysis Overview
The purpose of this project was to use unsupervised machine learning to dertermine traits and trends among cryptocurrencies.

The analysis was done by rducing the crypto currencies to 3 clusters based on the results of the preprocessing, then using those 3 clusters in the Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Cryptocurrencies were then clustered using the K-Means method, and visualized on 2D and 3D plots.

## Software Used
Python, Jupyter Notebook, and additonal lirbaries/ dependencies, Pandas, Plotly, hvPlot, and scikit-learn.

## Results
Though this analysis did provide some insight to relationships between cryptocurrencies and the traits they posses, it does not explain why certain cryptocurrencies are so much more valuable/viable. Further analyzsis may be needed along with additonsl characteristics that may not be present. These characteristics could include, but are not limited to: date the cryptocurrency was developed, if it is activealy accepted for retail use, or which countries it is available in.
